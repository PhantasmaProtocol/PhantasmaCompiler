# PHANTASMA SMART CONTRACT COMPILER #

Very early, alpha version.

### What is the Phantasma VM? ###

A stack-based non-turing complete virtual execution enviroment for blockchain-based smart contracts.

An early specification can be found in the [Phantasma whitepaper](http://phantasma.io/phantasma_whitepaper.pdf)

### How to build? ###

You'll need a .NET compiler like msbuild (Visual Studio) or xbuild (Mono)

The only dependencies so far are the Lunar parser used for manipulating the JSON ABI.
