# PHANTASMA SMART CONTRACT COMPILER #

Alpha version.

### What is the Phantasma VM? ###

A register-based non-turing complete virtual execution environment for blockchain-based smart contracts.

An early specification can be found in the [Phantasma whitepaper](http://phantasma.io/phantasma_whitepaper.pdf)

### How to build? ###

You'll need a .NET compiler like msbuild (Visual Studio) or xbuild (Mono)

The only dependencies so far are the Lunar parser used for manipulating the JSON ABI and the Phantasma Chain for VM Opcodes and other core structures.


Any questions, comments, suggestions, you can reach the Phantasma development team via tech@phantasma.io.
